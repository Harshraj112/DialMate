# DialMate

**“Knock on every door — one will open.”**  
In business, you’ve probably heard that if you keep knocking, eventually a door will open. DialMate applies the same idea at scale: instead of one person calling a few numbers, the system automates thousands of meaningful voice interactions so the right person picks up, engages, and converts. That scale — combined with AI that listens and replies naturally — turns many tiny knocks into opportunity.

DialMate is a Node.js application that uses **Twilio** to make automated outbound calls and handle interactive voice responses. It can:

- Trigger outbound calls to any phone number.
- Play voice prompts and gather speech input.
- Stream audio in real-time for AI analysis.
- Log call events and outcomes.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Voice API:** Twilio
- **Environment Management:** dotenv
- **Local Tunneling:** localtunnel (for webhook testing)
- **Optional AI Integration:** OpenAI / Google Cloud Speech & Text-to-Speech

## How it works

1. **Scale the knocks (Outbound Calls)**  
   The app sends multiple outbound call requests via Twilio, each representing a “knock” on a potential lead.

2. **Open the door (TTS Prompts)**  
   When the call connects, Twilio plays a message generated by Text-to-Speech (TTS), welcoming the user and asking a short question.

3. **Listen at the threshold (STT)**  
   The user’s spoken response is captured and transcribed via Speech-to-Text (STT).

4. **Decide whether to enter (AI Intent Detection)**  
   An AI/NLP model classifies the response (interested, not interested, follow-up needed).

5. **Respond naturally (LLM + TTS)**  
   If appropriate, the AI generates a live spoken reply using TTS, enabling two-way conversation.

6. **Logging & Analytics**  
   Every call logs status, transcript, and intent so you can measure performance and optimize outreach.
